üéµ Console-Based Java Music Player Using OOP

üöÄ Project Overview

A menu-driven console application in Java that simulates a simple music player using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

Features:

Add, update, delete, and display songs

Create and manage playlists

Play, pause, and stop songs in playlists

Supports song selection by title or ID

üéØ Objective

Demonstrate core OOP concepts in a practical Java project while building an interactive music player application.

üß© Core OOP Concepts Demonstrated
Concept	Usage
Encapsulation	Private fields with public getters/setters in classes like Song
Abstraction	Playable interface abstracts playback operations
Inheritance	Playlist class implements Playable
Polymorphism	Interface methods overridden in Playlist
Collections	ArrayList used to manage songs and playlists dynamically
üìö Class Breakdown
1Ô∏è‚É£ Song Class

Fields: songId, title, artist, duration

Purpose: Represents a song entity

Key Methods: Constructor, Getters/Setters, toString()

2Ô∏è‚É£ Playable Interface

Methods:
void play(String title);
void play(int songId);
void pause(String title);
void pause(int songId);
void stop(String title);
void stop(int songId);
Purpose: Abstract playback behavior for any class that implements it

3Ô∏è‚É£ Playlist Class (implements Playable)

Fields: playlistId, playlistName, List<Song>

Purpose: Represents a playlist with playback control

Key Methods:

addSong(Song)

removeSong(String/int)

displaySongs()

Implements play(), pause(), stop()

4Ô∏è‚É£ MusicPlayer Class

Fields: List<Song> allSongs, List<Playlist> playlists

Purpose: Manages songs and playlists
